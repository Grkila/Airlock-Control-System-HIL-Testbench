# ECC2S1 - European Rover Challenge 2025 - Airlock System

This repository contains the complete implementation for **European Rover Challenge 2025, Remote Formula, Challenge 2 - Infrastructure, Subtask 1: Airlock System**. The project includes a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulator, firmware implementations, and comprehensive testing tools for developing and validating autonomous airlock control systems.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The airlock system is designed to safely transport a rover through a three-zone airlock with two automated gates. This implementation provides both simulation and real hardware testing capabilities for developing robust airlock control firmware for Mars rover operations.

### System Architecture

- **Three-Zone Airlock**: Front Zone ‚Üí Middle Zone ‚Üí Back Zone
- **Two Automated Gates**: Gate A (Front‚ÜîMiddle) and Gate B (Middle‚ÜîBack)
- **Safety Systems**: Presence sensors and gate safety sensors prevent unsafe operations
- **Bidirectional Operation**: Supports rover movement in both directions
- **Real-time Communication**: Serial communication protocol for sensor data and gate commands



## üéØ Key Features

### Airlock HIL Simulator (`airlock_gui.py`)
- **Visual Simulation**: Real-time 2D visualization of airlock zones, gates, and rover
- **Interactive Control**: Move rover using mouse drag or arrow keys
- **Sensor Simulation**: 
  - Presence sensors for each zone (FRONT, MIDDLE, BACK)
  - Gate safety sensors that trigger when rover is near gates
- **Gate Animation**: Smooth gate opening/closing animations with particle effects
- **Serial Communication**: Bidirectional communication with Arduino/ESP32
- **Safety Logic**: Gates won't close when rover is in safety zone
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live sensor state display and serial terminal

### Arduino Control Panel (`arduino_gui.py`)
- **Manual Testing Interface**: Toggle individual sensor states
- **Real-time Feedback**: Display gate requests from Arduino
- **Serial Communication**: Send/receive formatted sensor data
- **State Visualization**: Color-coded status indicators

### Firmware Implementations

#### Control Unit (`Control_unit.ino`)

- **Pin Definitions**: ESP32 GPIO configuration for sensors and actuators
- **Real-time Processing**: Continuous sensor reading and gate control

#### HIL ESP32 (`HIL_ESP32.ino`)
- **Hardware-in-the-Loop**: Simulates physical sensors and actuators
- **Protocol Parser**: Receives sensor states from GUI simulator
- **Gate Control**: Outputs gate requests based on internal logic
- **Serial Communication**: Formatted data exchange with Python applications

- Serial USB cable

### Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install pyserial==3.5
```

### Hardware Setup
1. Connect ESP32/Arduino to computer via USB
2. Upload firmware using Arduino IDE
3. Note the COM port for serial communication

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Launch HIL Simulator
```bash
python airlock_gui.py
```

### 2. Launch Control Panel (to see status of IO)
```bash
python arduino_gui.py
```

### 3. Connect to Hardware
1. Select appropriate COM port from dropdown
2. Click "Connect" to establish serial communication
3. Use mouse or arrow keys to move rover through airlock

## üì° Communication Protocol

### Data Format
- **To Arduino**: `<PRESENCE_FRONT:1,PRESENCE_MIDDLE:0,PRESENCE_BACK:0,GATE_SAFETY_A:0,GATE_SAFETY_B:0,GATE_MOVING_A:0,GATE_MOVING_B:0>`
- **From Arduino**: `<GATE_REQUEST_A:1,GATE_REQUEST_B:0>`

### Sensor Definitions
- **PRESENCE_FRONT/MIDDLE/BACK**: Triggered when rover center is in respective zone
- **GATE_SAFETY_A/B**: Triggered when any part of rover is near gate danger zone
- **GATE_MOVING_A/B**: Indicates gate is currently in motion
- **GATE_REQUEST_A/B**: Commands from controller to open/close gates

## üéÆ Controls & Usage

### HIL Simulator Controls
- **Mouse**: Click and drag rover to move it
- **Arrow Keys**: Use Left/Right arrows for precise movement
- **Gates**: Automatically controlled by Arduino firmware based on sensor states

### Visual Indicators
- **Green**: Active/Open/Safe
- **Red**: Inactive/Closed/Danger  
- **Yellow**: Moving/Transitioning
- **Dashed Lines**: Sensor trigger zones

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

1. **Basic Transit**: Move rover from front to back through both gates
2. **Safety Test**: Position rover in gate safety zone and observe gate behavior
3. **Bidirectional**: Test movement in both directions
4. **Edge Cases**: Test behavior at zone boundaries
5. **Communication**: Verify serial data integrity

## üèÜ European Rover Challenge Context

This implementation is designed for **ERC 2025 Challenge 2 - Infrastructure**, specifically addressing:

- **Autonomous Airlock Operation**: Firmware must handle rover passage without human intervention
- **Safety Requirements**: Gates must never open simultaneously
- **Bi-directional Support**: System supports rover movement in both directions
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-second response times for safety-critical operations
- **Robust Communication**: Reliable serial protocol for sensor data exchange
